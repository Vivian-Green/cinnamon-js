# cinnamon-js
REPLACED BY CINNAMON.PY, likely will not work at all.

Defer to https://github.com/Vivian-Green/cinnamon-py

These files were uploaded AS IS for archival reasons, and served as a bridge between horrifying 2017 cinnamon.py and 2024 cinnamon.py, while discord.py wasn't receiving regular updates. They contain cringe, evil bad people language, and probably a few things I wouldn't say today. I have not even opened some of these files. Any tokens present are no longer valid. 

dependencies, from package.json:
    "discord.js": "^11.5.1",
    "performance-now": "^2.1.0"
